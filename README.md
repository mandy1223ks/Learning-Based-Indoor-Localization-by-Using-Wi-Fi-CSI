# Learning-Based-Indoor-Localization-by-Using-Wi-Fi-CSI
There are training stage and testing stage in the CSI localization system. The training stage is used to build the database model, and make the system  predict the localization during the testing stage. With the popularity of wireless networks and mobile devices today, CSI is positioned
Technology has grown at this stage, medical long-term care (elderly tracking), factory warehousing (asset monitoring), airport station (routing Citation), department stores (indoor shopping guide)... etc. are indoor fixed application of bit technology.
